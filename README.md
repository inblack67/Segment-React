Just open the index.html

LOCALSTORAGE - internal-123
To reflect an internal developer go to console, switch to Application tab, choose local storage -> http://localhost:3000, change the value of 'userId' to 'internal-123' and reload the page.
Delete the userId and reload to reflect the visitor again (Default Behaviour).
